# California House Price Prediction â€“ Linear Regression

A from-scratch implementation of Linear Regression to predict California housing prices, designed to demonstrate mastery over core ML algorithms, model evaluation, and deployment-ready code structuring without using ML libraries like `scikit-learn`.

---

## ðŸš€ Project Objective

This project aims to build a linear regression model **from scratch**, without relying on pre-built ML libraries, to predict median house values in California based on features such as location, population, and income levels. This serves as a foundational showcase for understanding the full ML pipeline â€” from data processing to model training, evaluation, and deployment-readiness.
